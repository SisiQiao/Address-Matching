# Address-Matching
Motivation  
You work as a Data Analyst for a company that sells a Point of Sales (POS) system to small to
medium businesses in the US. Your company has hundreds of thousands of clients and
continues to grow. (Maybe you work for Square, maybe Shopify, maybe Stripe, etc...) One of
the sales teams got their hands on a dataset of business names and locations and they were
trying to identify the companies that are not on the platform, in other words prospective sales
targets. You have been tasked with determining the overlap between the list of prospective
businesses and the internal client list.  
Problem Statement  
You are given two datasets:  
- left_dataset.csv  
- right_dataset.csv  
These datasets contain business names and their addresses.  
The goal of this project is to find the businesses that are common to both datasets, that is, the
businesses that have a name and address that match between the left and right datasets.
